This is my attempt at creating a "Mangnificent 7" for the fantasy premier league. "Megnificence" is a numerical representation of goals scored and goals directly assisted. 

**Notes**
- karma installed globally by running "npm install karma -g" and "npm install -g karma-cli"
- Developed on windows so made attempts to ensure linux/osx compatability but unable to verify
- Could calculate magnificence in the back end to prevent repeated client side calculation

**Stories Completed**
0.5 Display full list of players
0.5 Calculate and display magnificence (goals + assists) per player 

**Story Backlog**
0.5 Group players by position
0.5 Limit display to 1 keeper, 2 defenders, 3 midfielders and 1 forward
0.5 Display player team
0.5 Display calculation
1 Beutify position decoration
1 Beutify team decoration

**Cross cutting concerns**
- Responsiveness
- Tested
- Limit/reduce api reads
- Error handling

**Potential Enhancements (reword these to ensure they are baseda round their intention. "Quick epic (large story) requirement discussion with product managers could turn these into desired value and not solution**
- Internationalisation and accessibility scan
- Value
- Team inclusion
- Points recognition
- Share buttons etc
- Potential swaps
- Manificence per 90
- Points per x unit of price
- Trends
- Cheap players squad
- Most and least picked
- Liklihood of being dropped/injured
- Who should be captain 
- Players overachieving?

**Potential technical enhancements**
- Filter on elements?
- Caching of data (aimed towards static loading of screens where necessary)
- Performance testing 'framework'
- Inbuilt feedback widget
- Make 'widgetable'

**Next steps**
- To be discussed
